## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.8.8 using Jupyter Notebook server version 6.3.0

## Project Motivation <a name="Project-Motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Smithsonian Institution data on Global Volcanism Program - Volcanoes of the World 4.10.1, downloaded on 24 Jul 2021 at 11:16 AM	to better understand characteristcs of Holocene volcanoes for the purpose of Volcano tourism.



## File Descriptions  <a name="File-Descriptions"></a>
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results <a name="Results"></a>

**_The following questions were answered from the data._**
*How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
Which is the highest Volcano in the world?
Which country has the most volcanoes?
What are the most volcanoes per Volcano Type in descending order?
How many eruptions were in 2021 July YTD, and which were they?
Which is the closest volcano to OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa?
Which are the active volcanoes within 3000km radius of OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa?*
